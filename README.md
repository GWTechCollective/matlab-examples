# matlab-examples
This repository contains code examples maintained by [GW Tech Collective](http://gwtechcollective.org) for the MATLAB programming language.

## Versions
Mileage may vary based on MATLAB versions, but most code examples here will be written in order to maintain compatibility with [Ocatve](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) for the benefit of students who are not willing to drop the cash for MatLab.
